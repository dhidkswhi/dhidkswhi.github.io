        <p class="desc">When my mom tried to give me a cafe, there was nothing I could do, but I made it to be filial to my parents.
            It was made by my mom with the meaning of "fine" as pretty as a flower. We created a logo to match the meaning, but we used the cafe's symbol, the cup, and the "flower flower" from "fine" to express the cup in the shape of a petal.
            And because my mother likes elegance, she usually feels elegance, so she tried to express elegance using green, which was popular in Europe in the Middle Ages.</p>
